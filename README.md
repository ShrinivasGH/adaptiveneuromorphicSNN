# adaptiveneuromorphicSNN
Abstract
This project simulates and evaluates the performance of adaptive neuromorphic circuits designed for low-power spiking neural networks (SNNs). By integrating biologically-inspired mechanisms, such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and threshold adaptation, the design aims to achieve real-time computation with minimal energy use, suitable for edge AI applications. Simulations focus on pre-layout and post-layout analyses to assess the circuitâ€™s performance characteristics under various conditions.
